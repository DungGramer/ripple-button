# Ripple Button

Connect user input to screen reactions by using ripples to both indicate the point of touch, and to confirm that touch input was received. For touch or mouse, this occurs at the point of contact.

```html
    <button ripple>Primary</button>
    <button ripple ripple-dark>Secondary</button>
```

By default, a ripple is activated when the host element of the matRipple directive receives mouse or touch events. Upon being pressed, a ripple will begin fading in from the point of contact, radiating to cover the host element. Each ripple will fade out only upon release of the mouse or touch.

## Usage
Include tag here in to HTML

```html
 <script src="https://dunggramer.github.io/ripple-button/ripple-button.js" defer></script>
```
